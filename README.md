as well as what needs to be bought.

A user can join multiple groups which represent different households. Each group has a password that will needed if a user wants to join. A group will have its own
set of items and chores that users can view and update.

A user will be able to login or register an account on the gather database. They will also be able to update or delete their profile.
A user can view what groups they are in and toggle what inventories or chores they want to view from each group.
